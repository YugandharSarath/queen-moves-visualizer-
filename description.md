You're right! Let's add a clearly separated **"‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Constraints"** section ‚Äî aligned with your updated Pawn and Bishop prompts.

Here‚Äôs the **final improved version** of your **Queen Move Visualizer prompt**, now including **constraints**, cleaner structure, and no inline code snippets (as per Himanshi‚Äôs feedback):

## üëë Queen Move Visualizer

### üë®‚Äçüéì Problem Statement

Build a simple React app that shows a chessboard. When the user **clicks on a square**, highlight all valid **Queen moves** starting from that position.

---

### ‚úÖ Requirements

1. **Create an 8√ó8 chessboard** (64 squares in total).
2. Make each square **clickable** (to represent the Queen's current position).
3. When a square is clicked:

   * Highlight all legal Queen moves:

     * Horizontally (same row)
     * Vertically (same column)
     * Diagonally (all 4 directions)
   * The clicked cell itself must **not** be highlighted.
4. **Clear previous highlights** when another square is clicked.
5. On initial load, **no highlights should be shown**.
